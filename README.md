# Evaluator Optimizer

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementing the **Evaluator Optimizer** workflow using LangGraph.

The workflow demonstrates an iterative evaluation of AI-generated content (e.g., jokes). The LLM generates content, evaluates it using structured feedback, and improves it based on the evaluation until it meets quality standards.

## Contents
- `evaluator_optimizer.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook file with LangGraph workflow.

## Usage
Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab to explore the workflow and see iterative evaluation in action.
